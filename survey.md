# Introduction

This survey is part of a Year 4 project carried out by a student at the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Joint Institute (ZJE). All responses are collected, stored and analysed anonymously.

The survey explores your views on how some laboratory animals are used in scientific experiments. We also ask for some general information: your gender, your place and year of study, and an indication of your experience of working with laboratory animals.

We expect the survey will take less than 15 minutes to complete. To start the survey, click ‘Next’. By clicking ‘Next’, you consent that:

1. You confirm you have read and understood the Participant Information Sheet for this study.
2. You confirm you have been given the opportunity to consider the information provided, ask questions and have had these questions answered to your satisfaction. 
3. You understand that your participation is voluntary and that you can withdraw prior to submitting your responses without giving a reason.
4. You understand that your anonymised data will be stored for a minimum of 5 years and may be used in future ethically approved research.
5. You agree to take part in this study.
If you do not want to participate in this study, please close this web page.

## Part 1

In this section we explore your views about laboratory rodents (for example, rats and mice). Please indicate to what extent you agree or disagree with the following statements. 

*[Answer options: Strongly agree/Agree/Slightly agree/Slightly disagree/Disagree/Strongly disagree. “Anti-empathetic” questions will be reverse scored]*

1. It is morally wrong to cause suffering in laboratory rodents [*Pro-empathetic*]
2. Biomedical scientists have the right to use laboratory rodents as they wish. [*Anti-empathetic*]
3. Laboratory rodents should be allowed to live in an environment that allows them to express natural behaviours. For example, social interactions, building nests and digging. [*Pro-empathetic*]
4. I get upset, or believe I would get upset, if I cause suffering to laboratory rodents as part of a scientific experiment. For example, by withholding food for several days or injecting a substance into an non-anesthetised animal. [*Pro-empathetic*]
5. Using laboratory rodents in practical classes is essential when studying for an undergraduate biomedical sciences degree. [*Anti-empathetic*]
6. It is acceptable to breed very large numbers of laboratory rodents even if the majority of these will not be used directly in experiments. [*Anti-empathetic*]
7. The laws that regulate scientific work with laboratory rodents help biomedical scientists carry out their research. [*Pro-empathetic*]
8. Laboratory rodents that are not needed or used for experimental purposes must be killed in the most humane way possible. [*Pro-empathetic*]
9. I think of laboratory rodents mainly as a research tool. [*Anti-empathetic*]
10. It is acceptable to create a genetically modified laboratory rodents to be used in research, even if the genetic modification causes these animals to suffer. [*Anti-empathetic*]
11. I enjoy, or I believe I would enjoy, caring for laboratory rodents. For example, handling them, feeding them and ensuring their living environment was properly maintained. [*Pro-empathetic*]
12. Laboratory rodents are not capable of expressing emotion in a way that can be detected by biomedical researchers. [*Anti-empathetic*]

## Part 2

In this section, we want you to imagine you are designing a research programme. Each programme uses the same (and scientifically appropriate) number of laboratory rats. For each programme, please choose what level of suffering you feel is acceptable in order to achieve the scientific outcomes of the research study.

[*Answer options: No deliberate suffering at all/Mild suffering/Moderate suffering/Severe suffering. The aim here is to explore whether the commonness/rarity and seriousness of a disease (in humans) affects what level of animal suffering is deemed acceptable*].

1. **Research programme 1** will provide a simple, effective and safe treatment that will prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes in individuals with a risk of developing this disease. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects ~350 million people globally, has a strong and negative day-to-day impact on health, and results in the death of ~3 million people every year. 

2. **Research programme 2** will result in a simple, effective and safe treatment that will prevent the onset of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) in individuals with a risk of developing this disease. FOP affects a total of ~3,000 people worldwide. This disease is characterized by the transformation of skeletal muscle, tendons, ligaments, and other tissues into bone. People with FOP are usually unable to move before the age of 20, and die at a median age of 40. 

3. **Research programme 3** will provide a simple, effective and safe treatment that will prevent the onset of psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic immunological/dermatological disease that results in small patches of red and itchy skin, normally at the elbows and knees. Psoriasis affects ~150 million people globally. There is currently no cure, but it can be readily treated symptomatically. There is no strong scientific evidence showing that people with psoriasis have a different mortality rate compared to people who do not have psoriasis.

**Part 3**

In this section, we explore your beliefs about consciousness and emotion in yourself, in other humans and other animals.
For the purposes of this survey we define consciousness as the ability to have, and be aware of having, subjective experiences. Some examples of subjective experiences are hunger, pain and perceiving the ‘blueness’ of the sky on a sunny day or the sweetness of sugar. Note that self-awareness is not included in this definition of consciousness – an organism does not have to possess an individualised sense of ‘self’ in order to be classified as conscious according to the definition used here. Therefore, if you believe that an organism is capable of, and aware of, having subjective experiences about its own body and its environment, then the organism is conscious.
Emotion is defined as a conscious and subjective mental state that is sometimes accompanied by physiological or behavioral changes. Emotions can be positive (for example, joy) or negative (for example, fear). They can be strong or weak, long-lasting or short-lasting, directed to something in particular (for example, affection for a particular individual) or undirected (for example, a general sense of anxiety).
For each question, select one answer option.

1. How certain are you that you (the person completing this survey) are conscious? 

*[Answer options: I am certain I am conscious / I am fairly sure I am conscious / I think it is possible that I am conscious / I don’t know whether or not I am conscious / I think it is unlikely that I am conscious / I am fairly sure I am not conscious / I am certain I am not conscious / It is impossible for me to know whether or not I am conscious]*

## Part 4

What is your gender? 

*[answer options: male / female / other / prefer not to say]*

Where is your undergraduate programme based? 

*[answer options: University of Edinburgh / Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Joint Institute]*

What is your Year of Study? 

*[answer options: Year 1 / Year 2 / Year 3 / Year 4]*

Please indicate your highest level of experience of working with laboratory animals during your undergraduate degree programme. Your experience may involve direct or indirect contact with laboratory animals. Direct contact could be, for example, helping to carry out a behavioural experiment or collecting biological material from a euthanised animal. Indirect contact could be, for example, using tissue from an animal in a laboratory-based practical class. Select a value between 1-5, where 1 equates to no experience at all, and 5 equates to a relatively high level of experience. For example, a student who uses animals in in vivo experiments in their Year 4 project would likely select 5; a student who has used animal tissues (prepared by someone else) in a laboratory-based practical class would likely select 2.

*[answer options: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5]*
